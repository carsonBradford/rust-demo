# Overview

The Rust programs I created in this project are designed to help you understand some fundamental concepts in Rust programming.

The first set of programs introduced basic concepts such as variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, and functions. The variables program demonstrates the concept of mutable and immutable variables in Rust. This is fundamental as Rust’s variable immutability by default is a core aspect of its emphasis on safety. The expressions program shows how Rust differentiates between expressions and statements, a distinction that might be new to developers coming from some other languages. Understanding this is key to writing idiomatic Rust code. The conditionals program provides an example of how to use if statements in Rust. Mastering conditionals is crucial for controlling the flow of execution in your programs. The loops program introduces you to Rust’s different types of loops, including infinite loops. This is essential for performing repetitive tasks until a certain condition is met. The functions program illustrates how functions work in Rust, particularly the concept of ownership and borrowing. This is a unique feature of Rust that ensures memory safety without a garbage collector.

The linkedList.rs program is a more advanced example that implemented a simple text-based adventure game using a LinkedList. This program demonstrated how to use a LinkedList to store and manipulate data, and how to use Rust’s match expression for control flow. It also showed how to use the standard library’s io module to interact with the user.

By studying and experimenting with these programs, you can gain a better understanding of how Rust works. You can modify these programs or use them as starting points for your own projects. This hands-on experience is crucial for learning any programming language, and Rust is no exception. Remember, the key to learning programming is practice. Don’t be afraid to experiment and make mistakes. That’s how you learn!

# Development Environment

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a highly regarded Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Rust programming due to its cross-platform availability, lightweight nature, and robust feature set. The rust-analyzer extension enhances the Rust development experience by providing features like error highlighting, debugging support, syntax highlighting, and code completion. The integrated terminal allows developers to run Rust programs directly within the IDE. Additionally, VS Code’s built-in Git support facilitates efficient version control.

Rust Playground is a web-based tool that offers a convenient platform for experimenting with Rust code. It requires no installation, making it an excellent choice for quick experimentation. The playground also supports code sharing through GitHub Gists, and it provides built-in tools like rustfmt for code formatting and Clippy for linting. It can handle tasks like testing and compiling, and it even provides access to the top 100 most downloaded crates from crates.io. Thus, while VS Code is ideal for larger projects and long-term development, the Rust Playground is perfect for quickly trying out ideas or sharing snippets of code.

# Future Work

- Enhance the Dungeon game in the linkedList.rs file to be more advanced.
- Implement more advanced examples that combine the different aspects of Rust
